Workout app needed functionality list:
- upon adding athlete, have it create their own screens specific to them
- adding a group of athletes at once

- main menu and login screen decorations
- macrocycle screen, mesocycle box sliders with labels on them for the number in the mesocycle line that they are
- macrocycle year represented as a timeline
	- mini goals that are arrows pointing to points that the user sets on the timeline. This are stepped goals that the athlete should hit if they want to hit their final goal
- macrocycle year start month determined on athlete creation by asking when the goal is to be completed
	- the goal is the date of the final competition, etc. (crossfit games)
	- the macrocycle year starts the week/month after that goal
- what should happen if an athletes name is clicked on in the spinner but that athlete is not in the dictionary?
	- theoretically this can't happen as any name in the spinner has been added by the user and therefore is in the dictionary via the add athlete button
